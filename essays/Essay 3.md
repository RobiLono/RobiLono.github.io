The most recent WOD was Invoice2. To prepare myself for the WOD, I attempted to do Invoice1 again, just to give myself a sense of what I will be working with. For Invoice2, we had to modify Invoice1 w/ algorithms to determine the shipping cost. My first trial I got Sd, I had some minor mistakes that was causing extensive time. I took the initiative to watch the screencast to help myself understand what I was doing wrong the first time. After watching the screencast, I gave the WOD another try.
After completing the WOD, I got the results of Rx.  Reviewing back to my notes really helped me the second time around. I find it very beneficial (well, to me) to jot down notes (where I made mistakes) while watching the screencast, just so I don't have to keep referring back to the video. The future WODs are possibly going to be more difficult than these ones, so I need to stay on top of my learning.
