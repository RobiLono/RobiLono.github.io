- Introduction


My name is Robi Lono. I was born and raised here on this beautiful island of O’ahu. I am currently studying at UH Manoa’s Shidler College of Business, majoring in Management Information Systems. The reason why I am majoring in MIS is because I really like computers and I really believe the future is going to be all about technology. On my free time I like to play video games, hang out with my family and stuffing my face with ‘ono food. I really look forward to this learning new skills that will help benefit my future!
