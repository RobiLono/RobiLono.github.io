I didn't know where to start with BrowserHistory1. My first time I didn't complete it (DNF-30+ mins). I then made my way to watch the screencast, hoping it would help me understand it a bit more. I found it easier to have a split screen so I can watch the screencast while doing my WOD. My second time I finish in a solid 15 mins. I was not satisfied with that results so I tried a third time. But this time I challenge myself by not having the helping hand of screencast guiding me. My last and final trial for BrowserHistory1 was 12mins (Rx).  

BrowserHistory2 was completely frustrating. I had no clue to begin. It was like I had no way of completing this (within the time frames) without the help of watching the screencast. My first results was of course DNF (25+ mins). I had a hard time with linking the style.css file to the idex.html file. I honestly think that alone took me a good 10 mins to figure out. After watching the screencast I kind of got a hang of it. My second results was SD (16.32 mins). By the time I finished my second trial my brain was sore; having to constantly look back and forth, keep up with the video, making sure I have the right codes.. It was a lot to keep up with. Third time is always a charm. I guess as time goes on and you really take it the knowledge, practice makes perfect. My third result was exactly 5mins (Rx).

I don't even want to talk about BrowserHistory3.. I think this was the hardest one of them all. I already knew I wasn't going to finish it (DNF-33.48min). So I jus stopped my timer and watched the video (which I greatly appreciate it). The one thing I had the hardest time on was breaking them up into 3 sections (IE, Chrome, Firefox). I had no clue on how to wrap the text around the image. My second trial I finished in 15.54mins (SD). I'd say that's not bad for my second try (after watching the video like 5 times LOL). My third time, I was struggling because my web page wouldn't reload after I saved all the file. I'm not sure why that was happening. So I just continued, hoping I was doing everything correctly. My third trial I finished in 17.43mins. After trying it 3 times, I passed it with flying colors w/ the results of 7.36mins. 

I really enjoyed doing these workouts (even though they bust my brains). I belive this is a good way for us to pratice the content on our own and be able to challenge ourselves to do better. I really like having to reach a certain goal becuase it really make a difference in the ending; I felt accomplished when I was able to complete these workouts before the set time frames.
