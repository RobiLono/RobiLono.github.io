Coming to the end of the school year, my programming skills has made an improvement from when we first started. For me to fully understand the concepts, I refer back to each lab, wod, and exercises we went over with Professor Dan. Not going to lie, programming is not easy. It honestly takes time and dedication to fully grasp the skills being taught. 
Javascript has been one of the most difficult topics I've had to learn. Having to remember where and what codes to use has always been a challenge for me since day 1. 

Assignment 1 was to create your own workable web page, utilizing all the topics we've covered this semester. This assignment was very difficult because this was the first assignment we had to do by ourselves. The one thing that helped me the most was using labs and wod's as reference, watching previous screencast videos was also a helpful tool I've used.
I had a rough time with setting up my invoice page and linking it to my product display page. I will continue to watch screencast videos that were provided in the beginning of the semester and previous labs to help me. 

I really enjoyed working on this assignment. It really showed me that there's no shortcuts when it comes to coding. You have to set time aside to practice what you've learned and fully comprehend these skills being taught. 
Although my web page didn't come out the way I planned, I will continue to work on it to achieve the satisfaction for myself.
