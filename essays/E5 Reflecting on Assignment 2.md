1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
  Assignment 2 involves both input and oputput, while also using querystrings to transfer quantity data thorugh the login, registration, and then to the invoice. Doing this will let customers successfully choose products, then login (while also having the option to register if not already a user), and then finally to their invoice. If the customers login credentials are valid, their information will be stored and saved in a .json file for future purposes.  
2. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
  I did noy work with a partner on this assignment.
3. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
  I didn't get the help I need because I didn't use the office hours effectively and did not ask. (My mistake).
  I did get some help from other class members to clarify some stuff I was having trouble with, as well as doing research to find some examples that I can use to help me construct my web page. While working on assignment 2, I needed help with creating and constructing my login and registration page, and creating queryStrings so the customers login and registration info. are kept within those queryStrings.
4. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
  I believe this assignment integrated a bit more of a thinking process. We had to utilize a login and registration page, along with our index.html and our product_display.html. We also had to implement a user.json file so we could store new entries for new users.
5. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging).
  a) About 15% for thinking how to do something (this includes research also) b) 30% was due to writing code (utilizing other examples) c) 55% testing and debugging. It was kind of difficult because I things would work sometimes but not other times. Which means that I would have to go back and search where the coding was wrong.
6. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
  To be honest, im not really satisfied with the visualization of my webpage. I felt that if we were given a little bit more time, things could have changed. 
7. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
  If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would definetly take advantage of the help that was given to us by our professor. I would also start early on the assignment because it honestly does take up a lot of time with thinking of the code, writing it and testing it to make sure everything works smoothly.
